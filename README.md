# cl.js - console.log at the speed of light!
> A single line of code, 30 bytes small, to make every programmer's life a *byte* easier!

**Instead of writing this depressing and unnecesarily lengthy mush...**
```
console.log(testVar);
```
**Just write this!**
```
cl(testVar);
```
And for good measure, take a **[demo](http://codepen.io/johnchinjew)** *thanks [CodePen](http://codepen.io)!*

## Usage
1. Link cl.js to your page with a script tag. And, make sure you link it above the script files you want cl.js to affect!
```
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnchinjew/cl.js/master/cl.min.js"></script>
```
2. Alternatively, you could manually paste this snippet `var cl=function(x){console.log(x)}` at the top of your JavaScript file(s).
3. And lastly, use the shorter cl.js syntax! `cl(testVar);`

*PS: If you use cl.js locally, you could try renaming the 'cl' function to customize usage. Just a thought in case your having name conflicts or are feeling a little adventurous.*
